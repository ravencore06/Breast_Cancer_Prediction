# Breast_Cancer_Prediction
Machine learning project for breast cancer detection using Logistic Regression. Implemented in Python with preprocessing, model training .

Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression

📌 Overview

This project builds a Logistic Regression model to classify breast cancer tumors as Malignant (M) or Benign (B).
It uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, with preprocessing, training, and evaluation done in Google Colab using pandas and scikit-learn.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python 🐍

pandas 🐼

NumPy

scikit-learn

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, available in sklearn.datasets.
It contains 569 samples with 30 features each.

🚀 Steps Performed

1. Data Loading & Exploration (with pandas DataFrames)

2. Preprocessing (encoding target labels, splitting into train/test sets)

3. Model Training with Logistic Regression

4. Evaluation (accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report)

📊 Results

Achieved an accuracy of ~95-97% (depending on train-test split).
Logistic Regression gave reliable results for binary classification.

▶ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/ravencore06/breast_cancer_prediction.git

2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

3. Run all cells to reproduce the results.
